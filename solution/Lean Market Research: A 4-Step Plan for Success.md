## 1. Create Simple User Personas

### What Are User Personas?

A **user persona** is a semi-fictional character created using **psychographic** and **demographic data** from users who interact with websites and products similar to yours. It helps segment your audience and build an **ideal customer profile**.

### How to Collect Data

- Use **on-page surveys** or **emailed interviews** to understand your audience's needs and motivations.
- Ask targeted questions to uncover:
  - **Who are they?**
  - **What is their main goal?**
  - **What challenges or barriers prevent them from achieving this goal?**

### Best Practices

- Keep surveys **short and focused**â€”ask no more than five key questions.
- Focus on **role-related insights** instead of generic demographics like age or background.

### Example: How Smallpdf Created Personas

Smallpdf conducted an **on-page survey** that gathered over 1,000 responses in a few weeks. They discovered their primary users were administrative assistants, students, and teachers.

One key survey question asked users about their most common challenges. Based on the insights, they created personas like this one:

- **Who are they?** Administrative Assistants.  
- **What is their main goal?** Converting scanned PDFs into editable Word documents.  
- **What is their main challenge?** Finding an easy-to-use tool for PDF-to-Word conversion.

Hereâ€™s an example of their survey question and process:
