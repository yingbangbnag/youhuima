# Function to fetch and summarize articles
def fetch_and_summarize(query):
    googlenews = GoogleNews()
    googlenews.search(query)
    articles = googlenews.result()

    for article in articles[:5]:  # Limit to 5 articles
        title = article['title']
        link = article['link']
        description = scrape_article(link)
        summary = generate_summary(description)

        print(f"Title: {title}")
        print(f"Link: {link}")
        print(f"Summary: {summary}\n")

# Function to scrape article content
def scrape_article(url):
    try:
