# Web Scraping with Colly in Golang: A Step-by-Step Guide

## What is Colly?

Golang, a versatile and powerful programming language, provides a wide array of libraries and frameworks for accomplishing almost any task. One such framework is **Colly**, a fast and efficient web scraping library written in Go. With its simple and easy-to-use API, developers can build robust web scrapers to extract data and automate web interactions quickly.

Colly offers a collection of powerful tools for extracting data from websites, automating web interactions, and building web crawlers. In this guide, we will walk you through the practical steps of using Colly to scrape data from the web using Golang.

## How Does Colly Work?

The core of Colly is the **`Collector`**, which handles HTTP requests and enables developers to define how requests and responses are processed. By creating a `Collector` instance with `c := colly.NewCollector()`, you can start sending web requests and processing the data efficiently.

### Core Features of Colly:

- **Visit**: A simple method to access target webpages.
- **Request**: Allows customization of headers or parameters for complex request scenarios.

### Callback Mechanism in Colly

Colly relies heavily on callback functions executed during different stages of the request lifecycle. The primary callback functions include:

- **OnRequest**: Triggered before an HTTP request is sent, allowing custom headers or request info.
- **OnError**: Captures and handles errors during requests.
- **OnResponse**: Processes server responses after receiving them.
- **OnHTML**: Extracts data from HTML pages using CSS selectors.
- **OnXML**: Handles XML content or HTML responses for data extraction.
- **OnScraped**: Fires after all requests are processed, signaling the scraperâ€™s completion.

## Setting Up for Web Scraping with Colly

### Step 1: Environment Setup

#### Install Golang
Ensure you have Golang installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
go version
```

#### Choose an IDE
Select an IDE of your choice. **Visual Studio Code** is highly recommended for its user-friendly interface and robust extensions for Go development.

### Step 2: Project Initialization

1. **Initialize a Go Project**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to initialize a new Go project:

   ```bash
   go mod init colly-scraper
   ```

   This will generate a `go.mod` file for your project.

2. **Create a Main File**:
   Create a `main.go` file and add the following basic code:

   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, Colly!")
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Project**:
   Execute the project by running:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see the message "Hello, Colly!" printed to the terminal.

### Step 3: Using Colly for Web Scraping

#### Install Colly
Run the following command in your terminal to install Colly:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gocolly/colly
```

This adds Colly as a dependency to your project. If you encounter compatibility issues, consider upgrading your Go version or using an older version of Colly.

#### Core Workflow
Colly's workflow involves the following steps:
1. **Create a Collector**: Start by initializing a `Collector` instance.
2. **Define Callback Functions**: Register callbacks to handle specific events, such as data extraction or error handling.
3. **Visit Target Website**: Use the `Visit()` method to make HTTP requests to desired URLs.
4. **Process Response Data**: Extract the necessary information using registered callbacks.

## Practical Example: Scraping Wikipedia

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using Colly to scrape data from Wikipedia:

### Code Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/gocolly/colly"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new Collector
    c := colly.NewCollector(
        colly.AllowedDomains("wikipedia.org"), // Restrict to Wikipedia domain
        colly.MaxDepth(2),                    // Limit crawling depth
        colly.Async(true),                    // Enable asynchronous scraping
    )

    // Handle errors
    c.OnError(func(_ *colly.Response, err error) {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    })

    // Set custom headers
    c.OnRequest(func(r *colly.Request) {
        r.Headers.Set("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36")
    })

    // Extract and print data
    c.OnHTML("div.other-project", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {
        title := e.ChildText("span.other-project-title")
        tagline := e.ChildText("span.other-project-tagline")
        link := e.ChildAttr("a.other-project-link", "href")
        fmt.Printf("Project: %s - %s (%s)\n", title, tagline, link)
    })

    // Visit the target website
    c.Visit("https://www.wikipedia.org/")

    // Wait for asynchronous tasks to complete
    c.Wait()
}
```

### Output
Running the above code will extract project titles, taglines, and links from Wikipediaâ€™s homepage.

## Advanced Configurations

### Proxy Settings
To bypass IP bans, configure Colly with a proxy:

```go
c.SetProxy("http://proxy-server:port")
```

### Request Timeout
Adjust request timeout to handle slow websites:

```go
c.SetRequestTimeout(30 * time.Second)
```

### Limit Requests
Control concurrency and rate limits:

```go
c.Limit(&colly.LimitRule{
    DomainGlob:  "*",
    Delay:       1 * time.Second,
    Parallelism: 2,
})
```

### Error Handling
Use `OnError` to handle request errors gracefully:

```go
c.OnError(func(r *colly.Response, err error) {
    fmt.Printf("Request URL: %s failed with error: %v\n", r.Request.URL, err)
})
```
