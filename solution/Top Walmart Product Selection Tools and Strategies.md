## Walmart Product Selection Strategies

### 1. Product Positioning

Cross-border e-commerce revolves around selling to consumers. Once sellers understand the data and consumer needs, they should position their products accordingly. While following mainstream trends might seem appealing, market trends are ever-changing. Niche categories today could become the next big opportunity tomorrow. Sellers must clearly define their positioning, avoid blindly following trends, and focus on refining and optimizing their products to carve out a precise market niche.

### 2. Product Selection Ideas

- **Factory-Based Sellers**: Leverage high-quality production capabilities to create standout products. Explore untapped categories and invest in product redesign, provided you have the necessary budget and development resources.
- **Established Teams**: Utilize strong operations, marketing, and product development capabilities to satisfy consumer demands. Building a brand not only increases profit margins but also generates a loyal customer base.

### 3. Key Factors for Product Analysis

When analyzing potential products, focus on:
- Market capacity and trends.
