### 4. Extract HTML Elements
- Use methods like `find()` or `find_all()` in **Beautiful Soup** to locate relevant HTML tags (e.g., `h1` tags for product titles).

### 5. Retrieve Text Content
- Extract text using the `.get_text()` method for elements like product names or prices.

### 6. Automate Data Collection
- Scrape multiple pages by looping through a list of URLs. Use `time.sleep()` between requests to mimic human-like behavior.

### 7. Parse JSON Data
- Use the `json` module in Python for extracting and flattening JSON data into data frames.

### 8. Export Data
- Save the scraped data to CSV, JSON, or Excel formats using libraries like Pandas or NumPy.

## Python Environment Setup for Walmart Scraping

To get started with Walmart scraping, set up your Python environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download Python from its [official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Beautiful Soup**: Use the pip command for a quick setup:  
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```
3. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Utilize Python libraries like `Requests` for HTTP requests and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing.

### Example:
Use the `Requests` library to make GET requests and parse HTML content with Beautiful Soup.  
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://www.walmart.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
```

## Best Practices for Walmart Scraping

### Overcoming Anti-Scraping Measures
Walmart employs various measures like CAPTCHAs and IP blocking to detect and block scrapers. Follow these best practices to minimize detection:

#### 1. **Rotate Proxies**
- Use **rotating proxies** to switch IP addresses with every request, making your scraper appear human-like.

#### 2. **Set User-Agent Headers**
- Include a User-Agent header to mimic browser activity. This prevents detection as a bot.

#### 3. **Solve CAPTCHAs**
- Use third-party CAPTCHA-solving services or libraries like **Pytesseract** to bypass CAPTCHA challenges.

#### 4. **Use Headless Browsers**
- Tools like Selenium or Puppeteer help simulate browser activity for advanced scraping.
